iPad and Mini vs Google Pixel
=============================

So recently I&#39;ve been evaluating what my personal development environment is going to look like.  For the moment, it is a RaspberryPi and a couple VMs in Rackspace.  The primary difficulty with the RaspberryPI as the primary development box, is that while portable, requires I find either another machine or a HDMI display when I want to program.  This turns out to be terribly inconvenient when going to a cafe.  So I&#39;ve been looking at a couple different options, one going the Apple route:<ul><li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad">iPad 128GB + LTE (display)</a></li><li><a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD387LL/A?">Mac mini (headless build server)</a></li></ul><br><img src="http://198.61.227.199:5984/blog/_design/blog/ipad_mini.png"><br><br><br>The other going the Google route:<ul><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Google_Chromebook_Pixel_LTE?id=chromebook_pixel_lte">Google Chromebook Pixel + LTE (display & build)</a></li><br> <br><img src="http://198.61.227.199:5984/blog/_design/blog/pixel.png"><br><br><h5>iPad + Mini</h5><br><br>The beauty of the iPad + Mini arrangement is that it involves the least amount of work to get up and running.  I&#39;m merely replacing an existing Mac mini that sits in my living room (or expanding the cluster if that&#39;s how you think), and using it as a headless build server.  Using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xcode+Plugin">Xcode Plugin for Jenkins</a> it is trivial to setup a build server that can create new iOS applications and using <a href="https://www.testflightapp.com/sdk/download/">the TestFlight SDK</a> trivial to download those builds as they are complete.  This means I can write the applications on the iPad, commit and push to the Mini, and download the work product.  For those apps where I&#39;m developing everything on a Linux server, Rackspace provides and <a href="http://panic.com/prompt/">Panic&#39;s Prompt</a> is already a really nice ssh client I&#39;m using on my existing iOS devices.  This gives me:<ul><li>10+ hours of remote development time</li><li>2048x1536 touch screen display</li><li>and with a bluetooth keyboard (already have a few) I can type everything as easily as using a laptop</li><li>1.46 pounds to carry around with me ( 2.2 lbs w/ keyboard when I&#39;m feeling like typing)</li><li>another always on server warming my living room</li><li>128GB storage on the iPad + 500GB storage on the mini </li></ul><br>Over all for <b>$1528 + $20/mo. for 1GB/mo LTE</b> the two year cost comes out to <b>$1888</b>, but I can pretty much have a build going all the time and my lap won&#39;t get hot.  Also if one machine breaks, I still can use the other.<br><br><h5>Google Chromebook Pixel</h5><br><br>The other option I&#39;ve been considering of late is the Pixel. On the face of it, it would seem to be a far cry from the iPad + Mini arrangement as it provides one core i5 at 1.8GHz (vs 2.5GHz for the Mini), also on the Mini I have 4GB of RAM & a full iPad worth of graphics horse power to compete with the Chromebook.  The Chromebook only gets about 4 hours or run time too, so it will require carrying around the power brick adding to the 3.35 lbs of the machine itself.  So in the end, the iPad + Mini has better specs than the Pixel from a build box point of view, but the Pixel brings a few things:<ul><li>2560x1700 touch screen display</li><li>LTE w/ 100MB/mo free</li><li>USB ports (to connect to the RaspberryPi on the go)</li><li>SD MMC card slot (so I can add another 128GB SD card for $100)</li><li>1TB cloud storage</li></ul><br>When mixed with <a href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">crouton</a> the Pixel becomes effectively a functional Linux development machine, perfectly capable of doing local builds and shelling out to any remote servers.    With a collection of SD cards, and a little effort, the remote storage options start looking pretty decent from a backup of your data perspective.  But as 100MB/mo is pretty skimpy (a $10 value if you believe the carriers), it is likely that the baked in $240 of bandwith in the <b>$1449</b> price tag means the competitive 2 year cost is going to be $200 in SD cards (for another 512GB of storage) and another $10/mo in bandwidth charges or $240 over two years.  This would bring the 2 year Pixel cost to <b>$1889</b>.  In other words, it is a dead heat cost wise.  <br><br>I&#39;ve been amazed at how consistently costs are preserved across offerings.  Looking at the overall costs, getting a top of the line iPad and a lowest of the line Mac mini is a better deal than a Google Chromebook Pixel, but only if you&#39;re willing to use the iPad as a thin client.  If you want to carry your lap warmer with you, then the Chromebook may be a viable Linux development kit after some tweaking.  Either option will run about $944 per year ($79/mo), but you&#39;ll effectively never be offline.  Which is the objective when you&#39;re always living in the cloud :)
