AMQP for Lua
============

I&#39;ve just released the first version of <a href="https://github.com/cthulhuology/amqp.lua">amqp.lua</a>, a set of <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a> bindings for <a href="https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c">librabbitmq</a>.  This code makes it significantly easier to connect Lua programs to each other over a distributed network, all backed with <a href="http://www.amqp.org/">AMQP</a> providing a cross language interoperable message queuing infrastructure.  One of the reasons<br>that I&#39;m releasing this code under a BSD License is so that more Lua programmers look at it as a viable option when wiring together both applications and games.  Making applications AMQP aware will make it easier for a wide range of services to be <br>made available over the internet for general consumption.  <br><br>For the initial release I put together a very simple utility to send messages to an exchange with a given routing key (currently only connects to localhost as guest, but it is perfectly serviceable for demos):<br><br><script src="https://gist.github.com/cthulhuology/5080240.js"></script><br><br>It is about as trivial as an example that can do something terribly useful.  By specifying an exchange, a routing key, and a message, it can send a plain/text message to any consumer willing to consume off of the RabbitMQ instance on my localhost.  In a production environment,  I would add additional code for random reconnects to a cluster of RabbitMQ servers, and add additional error checking in case something failed, but that is mostly just hardening code common to most applications.  Currently,<br>I&#39;m just using it to test AMQP messaging in the next generation of <a href="https://github.com/cthulhuology/Jawas">Jawas</a>, which I will be releasing once the Linux backport is finished. Back in October of 2009, I had embedded Lua in the main<br>development branch of the Jawas code base, and relied heavily on LuaJIT ever since.    Now that I&#39;m adding WebSocket (RFC6455) and AMQP  support to Jawas, I found it particularly useful to drive it via a Lua interface.  I will likely expose most of my Lua<br>powered applications&#39; internal APIs to an AMQP based RPC method call system, passing S-expressions to be evaluated as either JSON or Lua tables.<br><br>So in any event.  Enjoy... This is a very early release (tag 0.0.2) and will likely see some significant API additions in the coming days as I build out some sample consumer applications, and demonstrate some very fun things you can do with Lua and <br><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> stored procedures.<br><br>
