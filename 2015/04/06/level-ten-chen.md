Level Ten Chen
==============

I finally leveled my Chen to level 10. The past few weeks I&#39;ve been playing equal amounts Heroes of the Storm and Dota 2. Playing both brewmasters back to back a bunch, I got a feeling for where Heroes needs improvement.  I also remember why Heroes is a better game for 10 minutes a match!  <br><br>Chen is largely immobile until level 7, when Brewmaster&#39;s balance gives some move speed.  In Dota 2, I tend to go for boots early, and generally find them around the 5 minute mark (if I don&#39;t go greedy and buy them out of the gate). Either way, by 8 minutes in, in both games you get movement. <br><br>Brewmaster&#39;s next item, however, with enough CS tends to be a 11/12 minute blink dagger.  A couple good ganks can usually get you there, and early boot help. Blink + clap initiation gives Brew a straight up initiation. Chen on the other hand doesn&#39;t get a equivalent lockdown until pressure point is unlocked at 16. As Chen&#39;s slow is pretty weak and his damage rather weak as well, his initiation is lackluster.  <br><br>After playing a game with my new masters skin, I switched to Jaina.  And WTF what a difference.  Aside from slamming d like a drunken master, after a couple games I was going 30:0 vs bots and 25:1 vs humans.  <br>
