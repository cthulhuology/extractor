iPhone auto incorrect
=====================

I&#39;ve noticed that the iPhone, while doing a great job at ensuring branding and trademark compliance, does a terrible job of picking words when auto-suggesting corrections for common words which are short.  While typing this it replaced take with Taos, but also allowed me to type thake without a suggestion. <br /><br />Suggestion it autocorrects perfectly every time though.
