A Self Language Build System
============================

After some though and deliberation, I decided that the most natural thing to focus on, after building a basic web server in Self, was a new build system.   Right now there are two build systems, one for a typical unix toolchain and a parallel XCode based build for Mac OS X.   Used by both are a set of scripts and a custom dependency generator that precompiles numerous headers in a platform specific manner. The thing about this system is that while very sensible, fails utterly at being "new comer friendly". Even relatively seasoned programmers take a long time to come to terms with the tooling. This can in large part be explained by the development history of the language. <br><br>My thinking on how to wrangle this into something the average hacker with a github account and a C compiler can contribute to runs along these lines:<ul><li>remove dependencies on everything other than GCC and Self (be self hosting)</li><li>script the build in Self so we eat our own dogfood on all platforms (be consistent)</li><li>build shared libraries when ever possible (be dynamic)</li><li>download everything from URLs (be distributed)</li></ul><br>The basic ideas are all thing easily done once you have a running Self system, and so the goal is to build a bootstrap system that can be downloaded via a simple shell script
