A New Kind Of Web Framework
===========================

One of the projects I work on every night is an attempt to build an implementation of <a href="http://selflanguage.org">Self</a> in JavaScript.  Right now most of this effort is located at the <a href="http://github.com/cthulhuology/Self.js">Self.js</a> git repo, where in I have two main files <a href="https://github.com/cthulhuology/Self.js/blob/master/self.js">self.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cthulhuology/Self.js/blob/master/html.js">html.js</a>.  The first of these, self.js, creates a set of extensions to the base language in order to support having function objects that perform dynamic dispatch upon their arguments.  The second, html.js, builds a basic web framework using the extension from the first.<br><br>To get an idea of how far off the beaten path this code is, let&#39;s build a button and put it on the page:<br><br>  button = HTML(&#39;element:&#39;,&#39;button&#39;)(&#39;contains:&#39;,&#39;test button&#39;)(&#39;style:&#39;,{ position:&#39;absolute&#39;, border: 0, color: &#39;white&#39;, background: &#39;darkgreen&#39;})(&#39;on:&#39;,&#39;click&#39;,&#39;e| console.log(this); console.log(e)&#39;)(&#39;to:&#39;,200,100)<br><br>If you load up the blank page in the iframe below you&#39;ll see it in action:<br><br><iframe src="http://dloh.couchone.com/blog/A-New-Kind-Of-Web-Framework/blank.html" width="400" height="300"></iframe><br><br>It works by creating a Self-ish object that has a read/write able slot to contain an HTMLElement and a set of 5 methods that provide styling, positioning, content setting, creation, and event handling:<br><br><script src="https://gist.github.com/1032798.js"> </script><br><br>This combination turns out to be all you need to build rather complicated web applications.<br><br>
