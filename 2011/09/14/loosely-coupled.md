Loosely Coupled
===============

Every time I see a new web framework come out, I hope the creator has produced something like what I&#39;ve been using. Rather than build a static page of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I hope that each new one will adopt a model of loosely coupled components that are self contained and communicate via messaging. Statistically speaking the number of other efforts in this area amount to little more than noise. I&#39;m hoping as a few other developers start adopting my base framework this will change. <br><br>There is a really interesting application of this model I would like to explore, where in one reproduces the functionality of X11 in a web browser. While not necessarily implementing the X protocol, one could easily build a Canvas widget that provides the entire Canvas 2d and 3d context APIs over a websocket. It is pretty trivial to implement on my current stack, and makes it possible for:<ul><li>2 or more people to draw on a shared surface</li><li>build a 3d accelerated application that runs on a remote server</li><li>layout virtual desktops that span multiple browser windows or desktops</li><li>construct a massive shared virtual workspace, like a virtual office building</li></ul><br>To do this on my current component framework would take about 32 lines of JavaScript. <br><br>Maybe I&#39;ll build it today. <br><br>
