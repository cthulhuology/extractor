Towards a Resource Oriented Framework
=====================================

One of the core ideas behind web design has always been mixing content and semantic markup into a unified document that defines how to render content. <br><br>One of the ideas I found most profitable from <a href=http://github.com/cthulhuology/Phos>Phos</a> was separating the Resource objects:<ul><li>Text</li><li>Image</li><li>Sound</li><li>Video</li></ul><br>From the layout and style entirely. Since browsers rely upon a combination of HTML and CSS to determine the behavior of their box model, and most of the display characteristics are not intrinsic to the Resource itself, this clean separation provides a useful point to introduce new abstractions<ul><li>Box</li><li>Button</li><li>Player</li></ul><br>A Box defines a set of behaviors that:<ul><li>contains 0 or more resources (items)</li><li>defines bounding box for display (left,top,right,bottom)</li></ul><br>A Button defines a set of behaviors that:<ul><li>implements Box</li><li>responds to 0 or more events (click,tap,down,up,move, etc)</li></ul><br>A Player defines a set of behavior that:<ul><li>implements Button</li><li>changes with respect to time (responds to time events)</li></ul><br>With these 3 abstract behavior types, you can build every interface on the web today. <br><br><br>
